[Rcouch](http://rcouch.org) has a **new home**:

[https://github.com/rcouch](https://github.com/rcouch)

All the repositories has been moved there and the rcouch release has
been updated to fetch the source from it. This change was needed to
ease its support and make more visible to the community the changes
made on it. 

Issues can be posted at:

[https://issues.refuge.io/browse/RCOUCH](https://issues.refuge.io/browse/RCOUCH)

and the wiki is available at:

[https://wiki.refuge.io/display/RCOUCH/rcouch](https://wiki.refuge.io/display/RCOUCH/rcouch)

All the repositories related to rcouch on
[https://github.com/refuge](https://github.com/refuge) will
be removed April 15, 2014, don't forget to update your links. Only the
source related to the [refuge platform](http://refuge.io/learnmore/)
will be kept and updated on https://github.com/refuge.
